## Summary

I am a software developer, DevOps, systems analyst and architect system designer. I started programming at the
beginning of 2000, and all this time, I was constantly learning and acquiring knowledge. I've always looked forward
and moved on the edge of technology.

Now I have been using Python for several years, I have developed my systems with Python. I am an expert in
"Microservice" architecture. For enterprise systems, I use Python (FastAPI as Web Frameworks, PostgreSQL,
SQL Server as Relational databases, NoSQL like Redis ) in Microservices structure.

I worked and learned in big teams as a developer, then I used that experience and formed my own team and
developed products. Given the wide range of knowledge I have from the computer world, I have the best ability to
make a team for startups and select the right staff for them and then provide solutions for designing complex and
large enterprise software. I helped several companies to start their work to organize their team and find the right
path.

I have programming in several languages such as Python, C, C#, SQL, Dart (Flutter for ), but Python is my
speciality. I also spent some time for personal work learning the Forex and crypto financial markets, and
developed tools for Forex and cryptocurrency market analysis I have developed using Mql5 (MetaTrader
language ) and Python.

Basically, I know no boundaries for new learning and experience, and I have no worries about my experiences
and knowledge being challenged, and I am fully prepared for that. I am ready to start working in any new
environment and I will undoubtedly grow myself and your company with the new ideas I come up with.
