## Summary
A passionate software developer, DevOps expert, systems analyst, and software architect, I began programming in 2000. I've relentlessly expanded my knowledge, consistently staying at the cutting edge of technology.

With years of software development experience, I've crafted software systems and mastered microservice architecture. For enterprise systems, I use Python with FastAPI, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, MySQL, SQLite, .NET, C#, and NoSQL databases. I have masterfully designed and implemented resilient multi-region Kubernetes clusters using Rancher as the cluster manager, OpenEBS/cStor for multi-cluster data stores, and Cloudflare for advanced load balancing and security. I embrace limitless learning and thrive on challenges. Ready for any environment, I will undoubtedly innovate and drive growth for your company.
